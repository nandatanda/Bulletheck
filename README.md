# Bulletheck
Bulletheck is a capstone project for an intro-level programming course. It imports its graphics objects from Zelle's 'graphics.py'. The game is a bullethell style shooter-like where the aim is to survive as long as possible given a shield which can block four bullets consecutively and recharges one pip every 500 points. Movement is bound to WASD.
